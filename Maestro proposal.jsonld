    "comment": "During the voting stage on Ekklesia, I voted ABSTAIN as I wasn't really sure about the merits of the proposal. Yes, the UTXo chains narrative is in vogue, but still this is a hefty ask from the treasury. I was especially interested in the open source aspects of GoMaestro's (Maestro's) output. I have to admit I did not have enough time to look into it during the Ekklesia voting stage - so, I ended up Abstaining. \nWith Intersect now submitting 39 different Treasury Withdrawal actions, I am now able to move from a more protective stance towards the treasury withdrawals to a slightly less protective one - as Intersect is not bundling dozens of proposals together. I was using the initial Ekklesia voting to mostly support proposals that I was more certain about. \nIn the case of the \"Complete Web3 developer stack to make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin\" proposal, I noticed a tweet from Maestro's Marvin DeFi stating that: \"Maestro will be open-sourcing its core multi-chain indexer framework.We were going to share this later, but since multiple people have contacted me regarding our Budget Proposal. I wanted to make it clear to everyone.\" [ https://x.com/MarvinDefi/status/1918923821979164936 ]\nThe key featuers of the developer stack will be: \n- Multi-chain compatible\n- Modular and extendable UTXO indexer\n- Block reorganization rollback protection\n- Battle-tested, billions+ in request volume\nMaestro has already received investments from Emurgo - which I think seems to be a very good decision by Emurgo to strenghten core Cardano projects - which are also trying to bring to life the compatibility narrative among UTXO chains. \nFrom what I searched, it seems that Maestro provides open-source blockchain indexing and data-layer tools for UTXO chains like Cardano, Bitcoin, Dogecoin. Their API-based services include UTxO indexing, blockchain event notifications, mempool monitoring, market price feeds, smartâ€‘contract triggers, wallet management, and transaction orchestration, all built on the same Apache-2.0 license opensource foundations.\n"
