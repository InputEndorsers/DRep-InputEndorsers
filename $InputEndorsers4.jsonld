I have lived in a war zone and poverty. \n\nI know how this technology can provide an alternative escape route for individuals being cornered. It can be a force for good. \n\nI'm in this for the big picture and for the ideals. I understand that people can be here short-term and for the money. Yet, that is not my motivation. \n\nIf we build a parallel system, we decentralize a key component of the world. Finances. \n\nI have an enormous respect for everyone who is building Cardano and taking a risk by investing resources. \n\nMy aim is to provide a completely independent and balanced voice to the debate and decision-making. We need decentralization and independent points of view. I am one of them. "

      "@value": "I am in Cardano for the vision. To build and run a governable and resilient global protocol of value. This network should serve as a viable alternative to existing financial systems for individuals around the globe. \n\nI have been in the Cardano ecosystem since 2017. Cardano offers a unique interplay of macroeconomics and finance, governance and individual empowerment, financial inclusivity and radical change. \n\nObjective: Make every ADA count. Frugality with the treasury is a must. The days of minting Cardano are over. Cardano ecosystem as a whole is now a currency user. We are no longer a currency issuer. Look it up. It is a big difference. Every ADA counts. \n\nConflicts of interest: \n\nI have never received payment from ANY Cardano developer team or Catalyst-funded project. I am not a member of any Cardano project, apart from being a user. \n\nI have been compensated by Cardano as: \n\n1. a Catalyst Community Reviewer Level 1 since Fund 2. \n2. a Catalyst Milestone Reviewer since Fund 10\n"

I have accepted and rejected hundreds of milestones from Catalyst funded teams as a Milestone Reviewer. I have insight into what is happening, the good, the bad and the beautiful. \nYes, it is a global view that is thin in some parts, but still an all encompassing picture. Cardano is a global project and a global perspective is also needed in governance, as is technical proficiency and knowledge of detail. \nI am financially unaffiliated with dev teams and do not have a conflict of interest in that sense. I am an ADA holder with the interests of the wider ecosystem and our current and future users at heart.  \nI have completed the Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate (CBCA) course. "
