    "comment": "I voted NO on this proposal during the budget structuring stage that was organized over Ekklesia by Intersect. I have not changed my original intention. I thank the proposers for submitting this proposal. This proposal intends to provide a Treasury-financed Ecosystem Exchange Listing and Market Making service pool which will provide MMAAS (Market Making as a Service). The eligible tokens are SNEK, IAG, MIN and HOSKY, as well as stablecoins USDM, USDA, iUSD, DJED, KINKA (gold backed). This proposal has not convinced me that the Treasury should fund the listing of tokens on exchanges. This entire process - if it is to be performed with treasury funds - should be part of a grand strategy that should look into the merits, costs and benefits for the entire Cardano ecosystem. We have so far heard different narratives about the responsibilities of different Founding Entities and their alleged failures to help list Cardano native tokens on Tier-1 exchanges. We are unable to get a definitive narrative that explains the background of these efforts and responsibilities. \nSo, we sort of start from zero, but we do not start from zero. Treasury Funding is not Genesis ADA. We all see that some Founding Entities still retain significant amounts of Genesis ADA and this ADA is deployed in governance to swing votes directly or indirectly through a choice of DReps.  Without full accountability regarding what was whose responsibility and what was a success and what was a failure, I do not feel that the Cardano Treasury should double fund something that was allegedly supposed to have happened so far. I prefer to make strategic investments in open source infrastructure that reinforces decentralization. Subsidies to native tokens - should probably be a rare exception, not the rule. "
