    "comment": "While there seem to be some open questions surrounding the definition of NCL in the Cardano constitution, I will sidestep that issue here. \nThe reason why I am voting against the proposed governance action is because it wishes to set a Net Change Limit for two years in one swoop. \nThis not only weakens the chances for the motion to pass, but it also makes it less clear what needs to be corrected if the motion fails. \nFuture proposers should probably focus on proposing a Net Change Limit for one year, due to the slow nature of decentralized governance. \nFinally, I was not convinced by the motion that there is an absolute need to set an NCL for 2026 this early, as it is March 2025. A lot can happen between now and 2026, setting a 2026 limit seems premature - hence a bad precedent. \nI welcome the attempt by the proposers to highlight a need for conservative spending, by roughly limiting the NCL to the volume of of Cardano annual treasury inflows in 2025 and 2026.
