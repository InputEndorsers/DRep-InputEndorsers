    "comment": "The proposed elements of the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and beyond seem to be pretty wide-ranging and I think that the product committee has done a good job. \nI would like to see more explicit references in the 2025 Vision & Roadmap web page (https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision-roadmap-2025/) to:\na. research on quantum resistance for Cardano \nb. research of improved algorithmic/collateralized stablecoin models for Cardano (i.e. improved versions of Djed-style stablecoins) - if possible\nc. as Cardano is being built as an alternative financial operating system, there could be value in conducting dedicated research on Cardano's current limitations/opportunities for serving as a financial operating system for the world. Especially, on how Cardano's capabilities can be improved to achieve this global ambition - outside of the typical blockchain trilemma focus (decentralization, scalability, security). \nI may update this vote with a larger rationale if the ongoing debate leads to new insights from delegators and other sources. \n"
