    "comment": "The proposed governance action [Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%] asks for an immediate reduction of the initial 20% treasury cut that was set at the launch of Shelley to the lowest possible rate of 10%. The Cardano constitution permits the value for the \"treasuryCut\" parameter to range between 10% and 30% (0.1 to 0.3). \nThis motion specifically requests change of the the parameter \"treasury_growth_rate\". It proposes the parameter be halved from 0.2 to 0.1. \nHowever, the \"reasoning part\" of the motion does not mention the treasury_growth_rate parameter - specifically. I was also not able to find the parameter in the linked documents to this motion. \nThe reasoning in this motion references mentions \"tau\", \"treasury cut\" and \"treasury tax\". The proposal does not directly confirm that this is in fact the same parameter that is proposed for reduction as the \"treasury_growth_rate\" parameter .\nHowever, this has been cleared up by  IO Engineering Head of Product for Cardano Samuel Leathers who posted: \"It's tau in Shelley Genesis. CLI team made the human readable name treasuryCut. DB sync made the human readable name treasury_growth_rate. all 3 are names for the same thing.\" [https://x.com/therealdisasm/status/1893361564780032172]\nKnowing all the terms above refer to the same thing, it makes it possible to vote on the proposed change. \nMy vote will be AGAINST this specific motion, but it is likely that I would support a gradual decrease of the tau parameter in the near future under similar circumstances. This would also allow us to observe the effects of such changes and also it would set a precedent for gradual changes of economic parameters, which I think should probably be the norm when possible. \nCardano is now a global financial system that DReps should carefully steer if possible. I have not been convinced there is a need for a sharp swing from 20% to 10% as there is no impending catastrophic event that prevents us to chose a gradual reduction. \nIf we are building a financial system, there is something to be said for financial predictability and gradual change. Outsiders looking at Cardano as an alternative financial system will look at how we manage change. Change is systems like this is supposed to look like gradual evolution - whenever possible. \nDisclosure of conflict of interest/bias:\nIf voting YES: As an ADA holder, I have a conflict of interest here, as there is a possibility that my staking income will increase by supporting this proposal. As a Catalyst Community Reviewer and Milestone Reviewer, I stand to potentially indirectly benefit from the continued and larger financing of Catalyst from a larger treasury. However, this conflict will be mitigated by the fact that I intend to either ABSTAIN on any future vote about the budget component/bucket that will involve funding for Catalyst or even vote NO if I find that the requested budget component/bucket that includes Project Catalyst is too large. I will never vote YES to finance Project Catalyst, due to my conflict of interest and my intention to remain objective. Also, I stand to benefit from possible DRep compensation if approved from the Treasury. However, this is something that I do not support and I will not vote in favor of DRep compensation. I think a vote on DRep compensation should not be packaged with other items and should be separate from the annual budget. \nIf voting NO: I am not aware of a conflict of interest. As an individual paying member of Intersect, I am watching the Intersect budget process - but I am not a paid or unpaid member of any Intersect working group, committee, organ or team. \nI am not an SPO, a member of a Cardano dev team or Cardano project. Nor am I affiliated or ever was affiliated with IOG, Emurgo or Cardano Foundation."
