    "comment": "I voted ABSTAIN on the \"A free Native Asset CDN for Cardano Developers\" proposal over the Ekklesia voting tool during the Intersect budget vote stage. I have spent days going back and forth over this proposal and how can I align it with my views about what can we do with Treasury funds sustainably. \nEssentially, I always have a lingering feeling that if we fund something commercial for \"18 months\" - we are really kicking the can down the road. And later in that many months we have the same can and just less money available. \nYes, this is an important tool for the NFT world to display Cardano native assets (NFTs &FTs) efficiently. The team members are known for their committment to Cardano and this works in favor of the proposal - as they have already built in our ecosystem and know it. \nNFTCDN is a managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider that here is asking essentially for direct funding of NFTCDN to make it free for all Cardano builders for 18 months under an SLA contract.\nMy knee-jerk reaction is to say no. However, this will ease the ability of other teams building on Cardano to integrate NFTs and FTs... However, they have shown the the cost can be seen as lower - if we factor in savings in other projects that will be able to use this service for free. \nStill, I am wary of precedents, so I asked the proposers over X (Twitter) about \"any intentions, plans, considerations about open sourcing your codebase?\" [ https://x.com/InputEndorsers/status/1949430196945178975 ]. Fortunately, the team saw the question and responded. \"@nftcdn_io Jul 28 Hey - great question & we appreciate you asking! ðŸ’™ Short Answer: If funded, this proposal gives us the usage data to pursue one (or more) of 3 possible future directions for NFTCDN: Open-source, Decentralise, or Transfer (e.g. to a gov-aligned org stewarding core Cardano infra). Longer Answer: Following valuable feedback from @yuta_cryptox  and other DReps, we've scoped three strategic routes post-proposal:(i) Open-sourcing NFTCDN for the Cardano public to use, (ii) decentralising NFTCDN, so that no one person/company is responsible for running it, or (iii) transferring NFTCDN to a public-good org that can scale it w/ sustainable ops (e.g. low-cost-country resourcing) to operate and/or maintain. Each route has pros/cons, and none of them are straightforward, but they all serve the long-term goal; ensuring Cardano's native asset display capability is accessible, resilient and easy for developers. This proposal enables us to collect meaningful usage and impact data, which will underpin the case for any of these options and our aim is to bring option papers for DRep signalling which would convert to proposal(s) for execution.Hope this answers your question!\" [ https://x.com/nftcdn_io/status/1949900316549202270 ]\nTo summarize, I intend to vote YES to this proposal, thanks to this clarification. However, my expectation is that the proposers behind this proposal will come up with detailed and credible options to put in front of DReps about the future direction of NFTCDN: Open-source, Decentralise, or Transfer. If these options are not clearly developed - based on meaningful usage and impact data, which will underpin the case for any of these options - well before the 18 month funding expires, I will not support a similar future funding request for NFTCDN."
